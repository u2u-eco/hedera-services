 * handling, since all transactions and most queries involve payments and thus the transfer of HBAR
 * from one account to another. The {@link com.hedera.node.app.spi.workflows.TransactionHandler}
 * implementations for the crypto service provide the API for all transactions related to crypto
 * (and token) transfers, as well as some additional API needed by the core application to apply
 * payments and compute rewards.
