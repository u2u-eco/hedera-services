/**
 * Defines a type that determines if a custom fee's payer is exempt from a given custom fee. Please
 * note that there are two other cases in which we exempt a custom fee:
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li>When a fractional fee collector sends units of its collected token, we do not immediately
 *       reclaim any of these from the receiving account (which would be the effective payer).
 *   <li>When a token treasury sends NFTs with a fallback to an account without any value exchanged,
 *       we do not apply the fallback fee to the receiving account (which would be the effective
 *       payer).
