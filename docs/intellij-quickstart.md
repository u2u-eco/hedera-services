# IntelliJ quickstart

## JVM

OpenJDK12 is strongly recommended. You can [download it from IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/sdk.html)
if you don't have it already.

## Preliminaries

Clone this repository:

```
git clone git@github.com:hashgraph/hedera-services.git
```

From IntelliJ, choose `File -> Open` the _hedera-services/_ directory you just cloned.

Make sure you are using JDK17 as the project SDK:

<p>
    <img src="assets/jdk-17.png"/>
</p>

Run the Gradle `assemble` task in the root project (for example, via the IntelliJ Gradle tool window).

This will both,
<ol>
  <li>Build the <i>hedera-node/data/apps/HederaNode.jar</i>; and,
  <li>Populate your <i>hedera-node/data/config</i> directory with 
  dev-appropriate versions of the <i>application.properties</i>,
  <i>api-permission.properties</i>, and <i>node.properties</i> 
  files that are used to bootstrap a new Hedera Services network.
  (To read more about how properties are sourced in Services, 
   please see [here](./services-configuration.md).)
</ol>

## Starting a local single-node network

Now browse to `com.hedera.node.app.ServicesMain`. Its
`main` method starts a single node network of Hedera Service by
calling `com.swirlds.platform.Browser#main`, which is the
entrypoint to bootstrap the Platform app named by the
[_config.txt_](../hedera-node/config.txt) in the working
directory.

Run `ServicesMain#main` with an IntelliJ configuration whose working
directory is the _hedera-node/_ directory of your clone of this repo:

<p>
    <img src="./assets/node-configuration.png" height="300" width="450" />
</p>

You will see a single black pane appear, similar to:

<p>
    <img src="./assets/node-startup.png" height="150" width="600"/>
</p>

This node's name is "Alice" because of [Line 26](../hedera-node/config.txt#L26)
in the _config.txt_ present in your working directory.

Looking closer at _config.txt_, you can see you are running Hedera Services
(and not some other app) because [Line 12](../hedera-node/config.txt#L12)
points to the JAR file you just built; and there are three nodes in your
network because you specified "Bob" and "Carol" as well as "Alice".

If multiple nodes Alice, Bob, and Carol are set up to run locally by
uncommenting lines [27](../hedera-node/config.txt#L27) and [29](../hedera-node/config.txt#L29),
they will all be running on your local machine; and
communicating via the loopback interface. But each still has a private
instance of the Platform, and keeps its own state, just as it would in a
true distributed network.

During the initial startup, the network creates system accounts `0.0.1` through `0.0.1000`.
It sets the key for each account to a `KeyList` of size one with a well-known Ed25519
keypair. The network reads the keypair in a legacy format from [here](../hedera-node/data/onboard/StartUpAccount.txt),
but the same keypair is available in PEM format using the PKCS8 encoding
[here](../hedera-node/data/onboard/devGenesisKeypair.pem) (the passphrase is `passphrase`).

Even more explicitly, the 32-byte hex-encoded private and public keys of the Ed25519 keypair are:

```
Public: 0aa8e21064c61eab86e2a9c164565b4e7a9a4146106e0a6cd03a8c395a110e92
Private: 91132178e72057a1d7528025956fe39b0b847f200ab59b2fdd367017f3087137
```

## Submitting transactions to your local network

The _test-clients/_ directory in this repo contains a large number of
end-to-end tests that Hedera engineering uses to validate the behavior of
Hedera Services. Many of these tests are written in the style of a BDD
specification. For example, browse to
`com.hedera.services.bdd.suites.crypto.HelloWorldSpec`, which makes some minimal
assertions about the effects of a crypto transfer.

Run `HelloWorldSpec#main` with an IntelliJ configuration whose working
directory is the _test-clients/_ directory of your clone of this repo:

<p>
    <img src="./assets/spec-configuration.png" height="300" width="450" />
</p>

Because [`node=localhost`](../test-clients/src/main/resource/spec-default.properties)
in the _spec-default.properties_ controlling the `HelloWorldSpec` test, this
will run against your local network, culminating in logs similar to:

```
2020-01-31 15:42:21.299 INFO   170  HapiApiSpec - 'BalancesChangeOnTransfer' finished initial execution of HapiCryptoTransfer{sigs=2, payer=GENESIS, transfers=[0.0.1002 <- +1, 0.0.1001 -> -1]}

2020-01-31 15:42:21.308 INFO   170  HapiApiSpec - 'BalancesChangeOnTransfer' finished initial execution of HapiGetAccountBalance{sigs=0, account=beneficiary}
2020-01-31 15:42:21.310 INFO   190  HapiApiSpec - 'BalancesChangeOnTransfer' - final status: PASSED!
2020-01-31 15:42:21.311 INFO   128  HelloWorldSpec - -------------- RESULTS OF HelloWorldSpec SUITE --------------
2020-01-31 15:42:21.311 INFO   130  HelloWorldSpec - Spec{name=BalancesChangeOnTransfer, status=PASSED}
``` 

(This client uses account `0.0.2` as the default payer, and is aware of the above
keypair via its configuration in [_spec-default.properties_](../test-clients/src/main/resource/spec-default.properties)
under the `startupAccounts.path` key).

## Stopping/restarting the network

Stop the `ServicesMain` process in IntelliJ to shut down the network.

When you restart `ServicesMain`, the nodes will attempt to restore their
state from the _hedera-node/data/saved_ directory tree.
In general, for
this to work correctly, you should precede shutting down the network
by submitting a `Freeze` transaction; e.g. via the
[`FreezeIntellijNetwork`](../test-clients/src/main/java/com/hedera/services/bdd/suites/freeze/FreezeIntellijNetwork.java)
client.

:information_source:&nbsp; In case of an unclean shutdown, or unwanted
accumulation of logs and audit data in the local workspace, use the
Maven `antrun:run@app-clean` goal in the `hedera-node` project to get
a clean state. (Or simply delete _rm -rf hedera-node/data/saved_ for a
quick reset.)
