/**
 * Defines a type that can perform a specific kind of state transition within the active node and
 * transaction context, under two conditions:
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li>Its {@code applicability} predicate evaluates to {@code true} against the active
 *       transaction.
 *   <li>Its {@code syntaxCheck} function evaluates to {@code OK} against the active transaction.
 * </ol>
 *
 * The context injects the {@link TransitionLogicLookup} with all implementations of this type, so
 * it is simple for the {@link ProcessLogic} to find the right state transition after it validates
 * that signing, fee, and other generic prerequisites have been met.
 *
 * <p><b>NOTE:</b> There is no strict contract on whether the syntax check requires consensus to
 * have been reached. However, it is recommended to make the syntax check evaluate only conditions
 * which are known pre-consensus. Ultimately we may move all syntax checking outside the {@link
 * ProcessLogic}.
